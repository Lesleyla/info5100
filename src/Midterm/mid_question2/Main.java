    1.Type of methods:

    for Interface:
    interface can have only abstract methods.
    for abstract class:
    An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.

    2.Final Variables-VARIABLES IN INTERFACE ARE FINAL BY DEFAULT:

    for interface:
    By default, variables declared in a Java interface are final.
    for abstract class:
    An abstract class may contain non-final variables.

    3.Type of variables-INTERFACE HAS ONLY FINAL AND STATIC VARIABLES:

    for interface:
    The interface has only static and final variables.
    for abstract class:
    Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.

    4.Implementation:

    for interface:
    Interface can’t provide the implementation of an abstract class.
    for abstract class:
    Only abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface.

    5.Inheritance vs Abstraction-THEY USE DIFFERENT KEYWORDS:

    for interface:
    A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword “implements”.
    for abstract class:
    An abstract class can be extended using the keyword “extends”.

    6.Multiple implementations:

    for interface:
    An interface can extend another Java interface only.
    for abstract class:
    an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.

    7.Accessibility of Data Members:

    for interface:
    Members of a Java interface are public by default.
    for abstract class:
    A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.
